The sequence is unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programming paradigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170; the second through Java in CSCI0180. The sequence requires no previous programming experience. Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education.\n\nAlthough students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming! All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures.",

How do these perspectives shape technical decisions computer scientists have to make? The role of computer scientists is rapidly evolving: as the systems they build affect everyone, from individuals to society at large, computer scientists become more than just coders. They must be able to assess the social impacts of the technology they develop and engage with experts from other disciplines which offer critical insights and normative perspectives on those impacts. The goal of this course is to enable you to understand and critically reflect on key concepts and ideas in ethics and social and political theory on topics ranging from fairness to consent, digital well-being to regulation, and to apply them to concrete technical decisions in practical exercises and project-oriented work.",

Likely topics include Markov chains, hidden Markov models, directed graphical models, mixture models, linear regression, regularization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, Bayesian inference, and multiple hypothesis testing. Examples will focus on the connection to genomics and molecular biology, but all of these tools have found widespread use in a variety of disciplines. Mathematical and computational exercises will reinforce the topics presented in lecture. Prerequisites: APMA 1650 or equivalent; MATH 520 or equivalent; APMA 0160 or CSCI 0111 or equivalent.",

Central questions include: what is the relationship between computation and creativity? How are truth and beauty understood and valued in our respective fields? What in the history of formalisms made the computer\u2014and computational imaginary\u2014possible?

Among other issues, the methods available for numerically approximating QSDs are not nearly as good as one would like, and to date there is a poor understanding of when QSDs are unique when the set is unbounded.

In this course we try to answer this question by examining how poverty influences child development and, ultimately, their income and wellbeing in adulthood. We will begin the course with an overview of poverty and intergenerational mobility in America, looking at historical trends and placing the US in international context. To understand why poverty is persistent across generations in the US, we begin with the economic model of skill formation in childhood. We then consider the existing research exploring how a number of factors explain the intergenerational persistence of poverty, including parental time, pollution, infant and child health, the justice system, neighborhoods, stress, and preschool/education systems. This course will involve reading and discussion of economic research and a final independent research project that will require data analysis and the application of empirical methods students have learned in econ 1629/1630.",

The analysis proposes a resolution for some of the most fundamental mysteries of the journey of humanity: What trapped humankind in poverty for most of human existence?

The class will first introduce and review important topics from game theory used in constructing models, but with an applied focus, taking into account common data restrictions and limitations. Emphasis will be placed on tools which can be used to complement existing research goals. Students will be expected to participate in class discussions, weekly assignments, and presentations/reviews of existing papers. Class time will be split between lectures and group discussions/presentations. The main deliverable for the course is to add a formal modeling section to an existing/ongoing independent research project.",

The prototype of a Lie algebra is the space of 3-vectors together with their cross product, which is closely related to the Lie group of rotations. We will see how this basic example generalizes, mostly in the context of matrices. We'll examine special types of Lie algebras, such as nilpotent, solvable and semi-simple, study root systems and their diagrams, explore some representation theory, and end with the classification of the simple Lie algebras.
