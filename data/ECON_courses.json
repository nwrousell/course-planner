However, regardless of our career choices, business and the financial markets play a role in our lives. All of us are consumers of financial services and we are all directly and indirectly impacted by capital allocation and market movements - it behooves us to be educated consumers, employees, business owners, and citizens.",

In this course we try to answer this question by examining how poverty influences child development and, ultimately, their income and wellbeing in adulthood. We will begin the course with an overview of poverty and intergenerational mobility in America, looking at historical trends and placing the US in international context. To understand why poverty is persistent across generations in the US, we begin with the economic model of skill formation in childhood. We then consider the existing research exploring how a number of factors explain the intergenerational persistence of poverty, including parental time, pollution, infant and child health, the justice system, neighborhoods, stress, and preschool/education systems. This course will involve reading and discussion of economic research and a final independent research project that will require data analysis and the application of empirical methods students have learned in econ 1629/1630.",

        "description": "Over the past several decades, the field of finance has developed a successful paradigm based on the notions that investors and managers are generally rational and that the prices of securities are generally \u201cefficient.\u201d In recent years, however, theoretical and empirical research has shown this paradigm to be insufficient in describing the various features of actual financial markets. In this course we will examine how the insights of behavioral finance complement the traditional paradigm and shed light on the behavior of asset prices, corporate finance, financial crises, and other phenomena.",
