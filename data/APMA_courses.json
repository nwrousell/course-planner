The mathematical topics include nonlinear differential equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and transport equations. The course is a natural continuation of APMA 1070, although the latter is not a prerequisite.",

Although they have a long history in probability, QSDs are not nearly as well understood as their (linear) cousins, stationary distributions. Among other issues, the methods available for numerically approximating QSDs are not nearly as good as one would like, and to date there is a poor understanding of when QSDs are unique when the set is unbounded. We will examine the topic in detail and consider all aspects, including computational issues using Monte Carlo and other methods. Prerequisites for the course are two advanced undergraduate courses on probability and stochastic processes.",
